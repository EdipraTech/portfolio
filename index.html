				<i class="tab">
					&ensp;My name is Daniel Arpide and I'm a graduate of Wentworth
					Institute of Technology with a degree in Computer Engineering. While
					having a curriculum based in both Computer Science and computer
					hardware, I have always had a stronger interest in the Computer
					Science side of the courses. In college the largest project I was a
					part of was when I worked with a team to develop an application using
					the Spotify API, during the creation of this I found that I leaned
					towards software within my degree. While this may have been the case,
					there was always an itch for using my hands that was never scratched
					through software. This would be solved shortly after as I began working on and repairing personal systems of friends and family members. Currently I am a technology assistant with an
					aspiration of becoming a cybersecurity specialist. </i
